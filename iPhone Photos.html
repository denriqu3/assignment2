    <h2>iPhone Photos</h2>
    <p>You really don't need a fancy camera or expensive equipment to be a photographer. Sure, they help when you're trying to get sharper quality and play around in different lighting or with fast-moving subjects. However, as an amateur photographer, my iPhone has served me well and is much more convenient to carry around.</p>
