    <h2>Nikon Photos</h2>
    <p>Last semester, I learned how to shoot with a DSLR camera on a Nikon D750, and this summer, I caved and bought one for myself. There are definitely cheaper cameras of the same quality, so if you're looking to buy your own camera, don't feel pressured to spend $2000. That being said, the D750 has great quality photos and I love the weight of it in my hands.</p>
